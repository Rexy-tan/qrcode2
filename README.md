Hi my name is rexynn. 

The tools and resources i used are:
-google
-chatgpt
-youtube

at first, i palced a color coded borders on each container so i won't get confused and i can better visualize the containers when coding.

i started with the html and the proceeded with styling. I have a bit of trouble making it responsive and i had to search about the proper sizes and stuff and not just paste the code that chatgpt was giving me. i find that i learn better in that way. lastly, i checked the link on edge and it seems to be working and i checked how it would look on phone using the inspect tool on chrome. then i deployed the website in using github.
